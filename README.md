\# free-the-quencies



free-the-quencies is an experimental audio analysis and sound-matching tool designed to explore and compare guitar tones.



The project started as a terminal-based FFT analysis script and has evolved into a modular, GUI-driven application built with PyQt6. Its core idea is to bridge the gap between objective audio analysis and practical tone shaping.



\### Key Features (v3.1)

\- PyQt6-based graphical user interface

\- Dynamic 9-band graphic EQ 

\- Editable frequency and gain per band

\- Gain control via sliders and precise numeric input

\- Data-driven EQ architecture prepared for presets and sound profiles

\- Modular code structure separating GUI, widgets, and analysis logic



\### Philosophy

free-the-quencies does not aim to recreate amplifier models or presets automatically. Instead, it provides transparency and insight into why certain tones differ, allowing users to make informed EQ and sound-shaping decisions.



\### Status

This project is in active development. Audio analysis and visualization are currently being integrated into the GUI.







\## Current State (v3.1)

\- PyQt6-based GUI

\- Dynamic 9-band graphic EQ

\- Editable frequencies and gain per band

\- Modular architecture (GUI / widgets / analysis separated)



\## Planned

\- Integrated spectrum analysis in GUI

\- Visual EQ curve overlay

\- Presets and saving sound profiles
